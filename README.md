# Fall 2022 CS170 Project Skeleton
This repository contains utility functions which might be helpful for solving the project.

## Requirements
`python >= 3.6` is needed for the python files.

C++ is needed if you want to recompile the code. If you have C++ already installed, then add [this package](https://json.nlohmann.me/integration/package_managers/#conda) using your preferred package manager.

If you donâ€™t have c++ installed, then follow [these instructions](https://www.msys2.org/) and then run:

    pacman -S mingw-w64-x86 64-toolchain
    pacman -S mingw-w64-x86 64-nlohmann-json

## Instructions
To compile run: 

    g++ -fopenmp -o main main.cpp rpg.cpp graph utils.cpp

To run the algorithm:

    ./main 

**Note: the algorithm takes a long time to run as it was run overnight usually.**

It outputs all the .out files for each graph to the rpg_outputs folder and to generate the tar you can just use:

    py rpg.py 

**Note: you might be told you are missing packages. If you are then simply use pip to install them (requests, Seleneum, etc).**

If you would like to run the python version of the code, uncomment the second to last line of rpg.py and use:

    py rpg.py

**Note: the python version has slightly less optimized parameters but is the same algorithm.**
